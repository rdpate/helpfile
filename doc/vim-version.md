Hypothetical Version Section for Vim
====

My current `vim --version`:

    VIM - Vi IMproved 8.0 (2016 Sep 12, compiled Apr 13 2017 15:09:03)
    Included patches: 1-507
    Compiled by root@103amd64-quarterly-job-04
    Huge version with GTK2 GUI.  Features included (+) or not (-):
    +acl             +file_in_path    +mouse_sgr       +tag_old_static
    … (another 29 lines)
       system vimrc file: "/usr/local/etc/vim/vimrc"
         user vimrc file: "$HOME/.vimrc"
    … (another 9 lines)
    Compilation: cc -c -I. -Iproto -DHAVE_CONFIG_H …
    Linking: cc -L/usr/local/lib  -L. …

As a version help file, the synopsis (version string) would be 8.0.507 (or another).  The remaining information can be kept identically:

    8.0.507
