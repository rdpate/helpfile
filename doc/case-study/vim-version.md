Case study: Vim Version
====

My current `vim --version`:

    VIM - Vi IMproved 8.0 (2016 Sep 12, compiled Apr 13 2017 15:09:03)
    Included patches: 1-507
    … (another 45 lines)

As a version help file, the synopsis (version string) could be 8.0, 8.0.507, or 8.0+1-507, depending on preference.  ([Semantic versions](https://semver.org/) are encouraged but not required.)  The remaining information can be kept identically:

    8.0.507

    VIM - Vi IMproved 8.0 (2016 Sep 12, compiled Apr 13 2017 15:09:03)
